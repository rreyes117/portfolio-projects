# Portfolio Projects

This repository contains a curated selection of academic and applied projects completed across high school and college. The goal is to document my progression as a quantitative thinker—from early applied modeling to advanced mathematical and data-driven analysis—while keeping projects organized and accessible in one place.

Projects span applied mathematics, data science, and analytics, with an emphasis on interpretability, modeling rigor, and real-world decision making.

## Featured Projects

### 1. From 40-Yard Dash to Draft Day: Evaluating NFL Draft Prospects Using Numerical Analysis  
**College | Duke University | Numerical Analysis**

A data-driven framework for evaluating NFL draft prospects by combining NFL Combine metrics with college performance data. Rather than predicting raw future statistics, this project constructs a continuous *prospect score* that captures readiness and upside.

**Key methods:**
- Least squares and ridge regression  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)  
- Monte Carlo simulation for robustness and uncertainty  
- Model comparison across Combine-only, college-only, and combined feature sets  

**Outcome:**  
The combined models significantly outperform single-source approaches, highlighting the importance of contextual performance alongside raw athletic traits.

### 2. Topological Structure of Shot Selection in Basketball  
**College | Duke University | Topological Data Analysis**

An application of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to large-scale NBA and NCAA shot-location data. Shot locations are modeled as point clouds in ℝ², and persistent homology is used to study the *geometry* of offensive behavior rather than isolated shot frequencies.

**Key methods:**
- Vietoris–Rips filtrations  
- Persistent homology (H₀ and H₁) via Ripser  
- Bottleneck and Wasserstein distances between persistence diagrams  
- Multidimensional scaling to construct player and era archetype maps  

**Applications:**
- Comparing NBA offensive geometry across eras  
- Analyzing shot-clock phases (transition vs. late-clock offense)  
- Constructing player similarity maps based purely on shot geometry

### 3. Analysis of Climate Change and Flood Risk  
**High School | Modeling the Future Challenge (Top 10 National Finish)**

A team-based actuarial and data science project analyzing flood risk for North Carolina and Missouri counties. The project integrates climate data, geographic risk factors, and insurance claims data to model flood probability and expected insurance losses.

**Key methods:**
- Logistic regression for flood probability estimation  
- K-nearest-neighbors regression for expected claim severity  
- Feature engineering using lagged climate variables  
- Risk stratification and policy recommendations  

**Outcome:**  
The project placed **Top 10 nationally** out of 150+ teams and was recognized for its combination of statistical rigor and practical policy insight.

## Notes

- Projects vary in scope and polish depending on context and time period.
- Some code and datasets are omitted where proprietary, academic, or size constraints apply.
- Individual projects may later be promoted to standalone repositories with full code pipelines.
